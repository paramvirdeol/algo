Quote: Linus Torvalds
	*"I will, if fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. 
	Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. "* 

Quote: Robert Sedgewick
	*"A programmer may ask why study anything else.
	There are plenty of reasons to study other things, but there are no good reasons not to study algorithms. "*
